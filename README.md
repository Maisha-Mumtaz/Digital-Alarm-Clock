# Digital-Alarm-Clock
A digital alarm clock using microcontroller 8051 is simulated in Proteus 8.13 and implemented in hardware.

## Features
1. User inputs the starting time using keyboard and the clock runs from that time onwards.
2. User will be asked to set alarm after entering start time. After choosing yes ,user will enter alarm time using keyboard.
3. Only valid input for time will be accepted. If wrong digit is enters the cursor will not move forward until valid digit is entered.
4. After all values are inputed the user needs to press ENTER key to start the clock. An ERASE key is present if user wants to change the current time or alarm time.
5. A buzzer will go off when the alarm time is reached. User can stop the alarm by pressing STOP key or can press SNOOZE key. Snoozing is possible 3 times.
6. 12-hour time format is used with provision for AM/PM.
